Usage:

    wrmdep [-a | -all | all] [file]

        Remove all .dep files or remove .dep files referring to <file>
        With the -a/-all/all option the .dep files are removed for all
        platform rather than just the current platform.

    wrmdep [-o | -old] [dir1 .. dirN]

        This occurs when a directory has been moved.
          - prints the questionable directory and *.dep file

        Note: to remove empty directories, run: wclean empty

    wrmdep -update

        Search all the "src" and "application" directories of the project for
        broken symbolic links for source code files and then remove all .dep
        files that relate to files that no longer exist.
